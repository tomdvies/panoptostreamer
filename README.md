# panoptostreamer
Stream cambridge university panopto links into an mp4 file.
Call `save_stream2` with your link, username, password and file name to fetch the file.
The code is messy, slow and badly structured, lines 86-89 in render.py are not required and are for my own testing.
Use of this code is probably prohibited by some TOS, obviously don't distribute mp4s generated with this tool, it is intended to be educational and an exercise in RE.
